Experts estimated that around 60 million cubic metres (2.118.880.002 cubic feet) had fallen from the slopes of Mount Askja and into the lake, making it the largest landslide known to have fallen since Iceland was settled, more that 1.100 years ago.  Water levels in the lake rose over two metres (6.5 feet) following the landslide. Ármann Höskuldsson, a volcanologist at the Institution of Earth Sciences at the National University, explained in an interview last year that area is still being formed and predicted that we would see more movement there. “Askja’s southern rim is clearly very unstable, meaning more landslides will fall this winter and next spring,” he told the Nation",Iceland,1.0,landslide,unknown,large,natural_slope,0.0,0.0,Iceland,IS,Northeast,1001.0,Laugar,83.92592,-16.7406,65.0167

The incident occurred on Wednesday 2 July 2013, blocking the entrance to the small gold mine where the men were working and trapping them inside. Local firefighters have made contact with three of the men, and are supplying them with oxygen via a hosepipe while rocks and debris are cleared from the mine entrance by hand to avoid causing any further ground movements. The fate of the remaining miners is unclear, and it is understood that the mine reaches 80 m beneath the surface. It is unclear whether the landslide was triggered by the activities of the miners, or whether it was caused by rainfall. Landslides are a common problem after severe weather events, as excess pore water pressure overcomes the sediments cohesion and allows it to flow downhill. Approximately 90% of all landslides are caused by heavy rainfall.

A huge landslide has opened up a giant 900ft crevice along a cliff - dramatically changing the face of Britain's famous Jurassic Coast. The colossal crack emerged in the land's edge at Bowleaze Cove near Weymouth, Dorset, after thousands of tons of earth suddenly gave way following heavy rainfall.  It has almost cut the land in two and officials have been forced to close a footpath on the side of the crack as it is feared further movement will occur.  Excessive rainfall has led to water seeping through the limestone. That has then mixed with the clay, making it far heavier than before. With the cliff unable to support the additional weight, the land has eventually broken off and slid towards the sea.  Coastguards are now warning people to stay away from the unpredictable and 'unstable' area which is going to start dropping 'like an elevator'.   'People need to keep dogs on leads and stay away from the edge because it is very unstable.'

The slide took out a slice of a steep, roughly 70-foot embankment above the 1800 block of Roeder Avenue, across from Squalicum Marina.  No one was hurt, and the nearest home — a green two-story bungalow at 1919 Eldridge Ave. — took no damage to the building or its yard, said Bellingham Assistant Fire Chief Bill Hewett.  Mud, sand and blackberry bushes fell onto the railroad tracks below, covering the northernmost track. Crews from BNSF cleared the debris within minutes.  “The bigger question is what the future stability of the slope is,” Hewett said. The bushes helped to stabilize the hill, he said.  Firefighters called city inspectors to check the safety of the hill and the homes on top of it.
